Authors' Declaration
This states Authors' declaration that the work presented in the 
report is their own, and has not been submitted/presented 
previously to any other institution or organization. 
Abstract (optional) (50 to 125 words)
Three to ﬁve sentences describing the essence of the work. An 
abstract is a short, 50-125 words summary of a work. An Abstract 
should state the purpose, ﬁndings, and conclusions of your work 
without commenting on or evaluating the work itself. Put the 
abstract on a separate page that follows the title page.
Acknowledgments (if any)  
Executive Summary:
The executive summary should be one to two pages' overview of 
the information contained in the FYP report.  It should give the 
reader an easy reference, in a very brief form, to the important 
information contained in the report and explained in more detail 
in the body of the report. People reading the report will use this 
section as a reference during presentations. 
Table of Contents 
The table of contents lists the information contained in the report 
in the order in which it will be found. All major topics of interest 
should be listed. 
Introduction
The introduction should contain a brief overview of the problem 
being addressed and the background information needed for the 
reader to understand the work being done and the reasoning 
behind it.  After reading the introduction, the reader should know 
exactly what the report is about, why the work was done, and how 
this work adds to the knowledge that the reader may have about 
the topic.

Body Chapters
Conclusions and/ or Recommendations
Present a summary of what you found in the results section. Here 
you should describe the techniques that you used for each 
analysis and the results of each analysis. 
Conclusions are broad generalizations that focus on addressing 
the questions to answer which the project was undertaken. 
Recommendations are your choices for strategies or tactics 
based on your conclusions. Quite often authors are tempted to 
speculate on outcomes that cannot be supported by the ﬁndings. 
Do not draw any conclusions or make any recommendations that 
your work cannot clearly support.
References 
This section should list all existing information sources used in 
the FYP.  It is important to allow the reader to see all of the 
sources used and enable the reader to further explore these 
sources to verify the information presented.
Appendix/ces
This section should include all supporting information from the 
project that was not included in the body of the report.  You 
should include surveys, complex statistical calculations, certain 
detailed tables, and other such information in an appendix.  The 
information presented in this section is important to support the 
work presented in the body of the report but would make it more 
diﬃcult to read and understand the work if presented within the 
body of the report. Appendixes may include maps, graphs, 
charts, or other helpful material.
Cite the appendix items in the report narrative (write "see 
Appendix A") and organize appendices (e.g., Appendix A, 
Appendix B, etc.)

BS Final Year Project Handbook 2023
Any tables, ﬁgures, form, or other materials that are not totally 
central to the analysis but that need to be shown are placed in the 
Appendix.
Footnotes/ End Notes
Footnotes are located at the bottom of a page. End notes are like 
footnotes but are located at the back rather than the bottom of 
each page. These would include all of the references for all works 
cited in the review of related literature or any other sections of the 
report as well as the references for quotations, either direct or 
indirect, taken from other sources, or any footnote comments that 
might have been included. These are listed in numeric order as 
presented in the text. 
1. Lani Arredondo (1999) Business Presentations, 
McGraw-Hill, pp. 23-34.
2. Jann Schill (1996) On Purpose, Heinemann, 
Australia, p. 23.
3. Paul Tench (1981) Pronunciation Skills, 
Macmillan, p. 23.
In case an endnote is followed by another citing the same source, 
only the word: “Ibid” (as above) shall substitute for the entire 
text. If the page no. is diﬀerent, then the page number shall 
appear after the word: “Ibid”. For example:
1. Jann Schill (1996) On Purpose, Heinemann, Australia,  
p. 23.
    Ibid., p. 54.
In case the same source comes to be mentioned after a few 
interrupting sources, then the word “op cit” would suﬃce 
(mentioned earlier is written), followed by the page number.
Bibliography or Literature Cited
Bibliography will appear in alphabetic order of the authors' 
surnames. Author's surname shall come ﬁrst as is the case in the 
catalogues of libraries.

Page Numbers
Except for the title page, number all pages which come before the 
ﬁrst page of the body chapters consecutively with lower case 
roman numerals (i, ii, iii, iv,…). 
The ﬁrst page with Arabic numeral (1, 2, 3, and so on) starts from 
the page of the introduction but it is mentioned from page 2 
onwards.
Mention page numbers on the top right of the page. The ﬁrst page 
of each section or chapter will not carry the page number; 
however, the page number will be counted for the proceeding 
page.
Headers
The header will comprise the title of the Project report. On every 
odd page will appear the title of the report while on the even 
pages the title of the chapter or section will be mentioned. The 
ﬁrst page of every section or chapter shall not carry the header.
