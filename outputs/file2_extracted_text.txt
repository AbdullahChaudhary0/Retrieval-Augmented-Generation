Shareholders’ Equity (or Net Worth). The assets and liabilities are 
typically listed in order of liquidity and separated between current and 
non-current.
The income statement covers a period of time, such as a quarter or 
year. It illustrates the profitability of the company from an accounting 
(accrual and matching) perspective. It starts with the revenue line and 
after deducting expenses derives net income.
The cash flow statement look at the cash position of the company . 
It answers it answers the questions ; How much of the organisation’s
cash goes to its creditors and shareholders?  Does it keep enough for 
its own investment and growth?  has 3 components  cash from 
operations, cash used in investing, and cash from financing.   It 
“undoes” all of the accounting principles and shows the cash flows of 
the business.
